## More Logical variables  {.shout}

## Logical vectors

- Vectors consisting of values `TRUE` and `FALSE`
- Usually created with a logical comparison
- `&` and `|` are the logical *and* and *or*
- `!` is the logical negation
- `<, >, ==, !=, <=, >=` are the comparison operators
- `x %in% c(1, 4, 3, 7)` tells whether each element of `x` is one of `c(1, 4, 3, 7)`
- use parentheses `()` when linking expressions to avoid mis-interpretation

## Logical Operations

<span style="color:white">
Define a vector: `a <- c(1, 15, 3, 20, 5, 8, 9, 10, 1, 3)`

<span style="color:white">
Find the expression for the logical vector that is TRUE where `a` is:
</span>

<span style="color:white"><img src="images/green.png" width=20> less than 20</span><br/>
<span style="color:white"><img src="images/green.png" width=20> squared value is either at least 100 or less than 10</span><br/>
<span style="color:white"><img src="images/green.png" width=20> equals 1 or 3 or 5</span><br/>
<span style="color:white"><img src="images/blue.png" width=20> even. 
  Hint: have a look at the help for the operator `%%`</span>

## `Subsetting Data Frames`
```{r}
library(classdata)
Iowa2009 <- fbi[fbi$State == 'Iowa' & fbi$Year == 2009, ] 
str(Iowa2009)
```

Other useful functions for subsetting data frames are `subset` and `dplyr::filter` (later)


## Updating elements in a data set

Data sets and their parts can be used as the left hand side (LHS) of an assignment:

```{r}
fbi$State[fbi$State == 'Iowa'] <- 'Our State'
unique(fbi$State)[10:20]
```

```{r}
# Round the population to nearest thousands
fbi$Population <- signif(fbi$Population, 3)
str(fbi$Population)
```
If that column exists before, it is being over-written/updated
