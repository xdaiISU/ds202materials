## Factor variables {.shout}

## Factors


- A special type of variable to indicate *categories*
- Stores both *labels* and their *order* (i.e. numbers).  It is more than a character vector.
- Often times text variables are stored in factors during input by default
- Numeric categorical variables have to be converted to factors manually
- `factor` creates a new factor with specified labels



## Your Turn {.white}

<img class="cover" src="images/blue.jpeg" alt="" width=2000>

- <span style="color:white"><img src="images/green.png" width=20> Inspect the `fbi` object. How is it different from the `cities` data we looked at before?</span>
- <span style="color:white"><img src="images/green.png" width=20> How many variables are there? Which type does each of the variables have?</span>
- <span style="color:white"><img src="images/green.png" width=20> Make a summary of Year using `summary()`</span>
- <span style="color:white"><img src="images/green.png" width=20> Make Year  a factor variable: `fbi$Year <- factor(fbi$Year)`</span>
- <span style="color:white"><img src="images/green.png" width=20> Compare summary of Year to the previous result</span>

## Note: factors in boxplots

`boxplot` works properly if the x variable is a character variable or a factor:

```{r, fig.width=8}
library(classdata)
boxplot(fbi$Count ~ fbi$Type)
```

## Levels of factor variables

- `levels(x)` shows us the levels of factor variable `x` in their current order
- Factor variables often have to be re-ordered for ease of comparisons
- We can specify the order of the levels by explicitly listing them, see `help(factor)`
- We can make the order of the levels in one variable dependent on the summary statistic of another variable


## Reordering factor levels manually

```{r}
levels(fbi$Type)
```

Reorder so that property crimes come first (extremely sensitive to typos):

```{r}
levels(factor(fbi$Type, levels=c("Larceny.theft", "Burglary", "Motor.vehicle.theft", "Aggravated.assault", "Robbery", "Legacy.rape", "Murder.and.nonnegligent.Manslaughter", "Rape")))
```

## Reordering factor levels - using another variable

`reorder(factor, numbers, function)`

reorder levels in factor by values in `numbers`. Use `function` to summarize (average is used by default). 

```{r}
levels(reorder(fbi$Type, fbi$Count, mean, na.rm=TRUE))
```
Missing values in `numbers`? make sure to use parameter `na.rm=TRUE`!

## Changing levels' names

```{r}
levels(fbi$Type)
```

```{r}
levels(fbi$Type)[6] <- "Murder"

levels(fbi$Type)
```


## Your turn {.white}

<img class="cover" src="images/blue.jpeg" alt="" width=2000>

<span style="color:white">For this your turn use the `fbi` object from the `classdata` package. </span>

- <span style="color:white"><img src="images/green.png" width=20> Introduce a rate of the number of reported offenses by population into the `fbi` data. </span>
- <span style="color:white"><img src="images/blue.png" width=20> 
Plot boxplots of crime rates by different types of crime. How can you make axis text legible? </span>
- <span style="color:white"><img src="images/blue.png" width=20> 
Reorder the boxplots of crime rates, such that the boxplots are ordered by their medians. </span>
- <span style="color:white"><img src="images/black.png" width=20> 
For one type of crime (subset!), plot boxplots of rates by state, reorder boxplots by median crime rates</span>

## Data types: checking and casting

Checking for, and casting between types: 

- `str`, `class` provide info on type
- `is.XXX` (with XXX either `factor, int, numeric, logical, character, ...` ) checks for specific type
- `as.XXX` casts to specific type


## Casting between types

![](images/casting.png)
**Note:** `as.numeric` applied to a factor retrieves *order* of labels, not labels, even if those could be interpreted as numbers.

To get the labels of a factor as numbers, first cast to character and then to a number.
