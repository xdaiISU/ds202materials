## [Git Terminology](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/)

- **Repository:** A project's folder tracked by `git`, containing all of the project files and their __revision history__ 
- **Commit:** A checkpoint/snapshot for the local clone to save changes to a file (or set of files). 

## More Terminology 
- **Remote repository:** This is the version of a repo that is hosted on a server, such as GitHub
- **Local repository**: In collaboration, each person will own a local repository sitting on their own computers. Local repositories are usually set up to track a remote 
- **Clone:** A copy of a remote repository
- **Pull:** Obtaining the commits from the remote repository
- **Push:** Sending your local commits to the remote repository
<!-- - **Fork:** A copy of a repository that includes (or will potentially include) changes. Forking allow you to freely make changes to an existing project without affecting the original.  -->

## Repositories

By default, all materials on GitHub are **public**. This is *good* because you are getting your work out there and contributing to the open source community! 

If you need **private** repos, checkout [GitHub for Education](https://education.github.com/) - free private repos for students/postdocs/professors.
