## Reproducible Analysis {.shout}

## R file

- This is the quickest way to write reproducible codes
- R codes are usually written in R files with extension `.R`
- Code in an R file can be run line by line, or with the entire file "sourced", so that all results are reproduced

## Markdown

- `Markdown` is a particular type of **markup** language.
- Markup languages are designed to **produce documents from plain text**.
<!-- - Some of you may be familiar with `LaTeX`. This is another (less user-friendly) markup language for creating pdf documents. -->
<!-- 
- LaTeX gives you much greater control, but it is restricted to pdf and has a much greater learning curve.
-->
- **Markdown** is becoming a **standard** on the web. Many websites will generate HTML from Markdown (e.g. GitHub, Stack Overflow, reddit, ...).

## Markdown is easy

## Built upon Markdown: RMarkdown

- RMarkdown is an authoring format that enables easy creation of dynamic documents, presentations, and reports from R 
- It combines the core syntax of markdown with embedded R code chunks that are run so their output can be included in the final document.
- R Markdown documents are reproducible. They are generated as if you just start up R.

## Why R Markdown?

- **It's simple.** Focus on writing
<!-- , rather than debugging silly errors. -->
- **It's flexible.** Markdown was created to simplify writing HTML, but thanks to pandoc, Markdown converts to many different formats such as pdf and Word!
- **It's dynamic.** Get a new dataset? Regenerate your report without copy/paste hell!
- **Encourages transparency.** Collaborators (including your future self) will thank you for integrating your analysis & report.
- **Enables interactivity/reactivity.** Allow your audience to explore the analysis (rather than passively reading it).

3. <span style="color:white"><img src="images/green.png" width=20> Make changes to the markdown formatting (try several) and knit again.</span>
4. <span style="color:white"><img src="images/green.png" width=20> Export output to different files.</span>
5. <span style="color:white"><img src="images/blue.png" width=20> If you feel adventurous, change some of the R code and knit again.</span>
6. <span style="color:white"><img src="images/blue.png" width=20> If you are all done, you can follow the guideline of HW1 and finish the first few questions.</span>
